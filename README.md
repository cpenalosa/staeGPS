<h2> stae GPS </h2>

<p> Start submitting GPS data to your city's stae account in real-time. </p> <br>

The following scripts in this guide currently work on the Rapsberry Pi 3, Model B with a USB GPS receiver.<br>

To get started, create an account at <a href="https://municipal.systems" target="_blank"> Municipal Systems</a>. Once you're in, make a data source for your GPS vehicle and copy your secret API key. Once you have the key, you're ready to begin the tutorial!<br>

Happy building! <br>
