<h2> stae GPS </h2>

<p> Start submitting GPS data to your city's stae account in real-time. </p> <br>

The following scripts in this guide currently work on the Rapsberry Pi 3, Model B with a USB GPS receiver.<br>

To get started, create an account at <a href="https://municipal.systems" target="_blank"> Municipal Systems</a>. Once you're in, make a data source for your GPS vehicle and copy your secret API key. Once you have the key, you're ready to begin the tutorial!<br>

Happy building! <br>

<h3> What is This Tutorial For? </h3>
<p> Make your first data import to stae using locational data. Maybe you’d like to create a tracker for your vehicle fleet? Or place the device on an emergency vehicle and track it’s routes to optimize traffic patterns? We used it to track Snow Plows during the winter so people know when the plows are coming.</p>

<h3> Gathering the Materials to build a USB GPS Receiver </h3>
<p> Most of the materials can be sourced from Amazon, with the exception of the SIM cards. If you’re going to use this receiver for real time data, then check out Twilio’s data plan on the T-Mobile network for transmitting wireless data. If you don’t go the USB Modem route, that’s okay, too. Your data can be retrieved at any point on the device and uploaded to stae via the importer. </p>
